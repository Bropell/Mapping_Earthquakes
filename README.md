# Mapping_Earthquakes
## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes 
all over the world for the last seven days using GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website. The
result is an interactive layer map as seen in the images below. There are three different tile layers 
to toggle between and three other layers to enable in order to see different data on the map. The first 
image shows the street tile layer with the earthquake and tectonic plate data.

The following image shows the satellite tile layer with the tectonic plate data and only the major 
earthquake locations.

The final image shows the dark tile layer with only the tectonic plate data. Any combination
of these maps is available for use in this project. Additional style changes or tile layers 
can be added easily using the Leaflet documentation and making minor changes to the JS script.
